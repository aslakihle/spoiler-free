Current major todos:

- Implement a add/edit system for the wiki (pretty cruicial for the site to actually serve a function)<br>
- Backend. Currently using dummydata in state.
- User system with login/register/profile page



Smaller todos/issues:

- Make a fact/details element for each wikicontent (similar to the element to the right on a wikipedia page)
- Proper fonts, and implementation
- /wiki/123/123 currently breaks the page, there are no checks if the URL parameters exist in 'database', only occurs if you edit URL
- Add active/current both in header links and for topics
