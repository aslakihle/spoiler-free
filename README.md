SpoilerFree is a wiki for different book series where you select how many books you have read before you get the information, so you dont get spoilers from unread books.


Current major todos:

- Implement a add/edit system for wiki entries and categories
- Backend. Currently using dummydata in state.
- User system with login/register/profile page
- Make the website respoisive(Currently only made for laptop/desktop)


Smaller todos/issues:

- Make a fact/details element for each wikicontent (similar to the element to the right on a wikipedia page)
- Proper fonts, and implementation
- /wiki/123/123 currently breaks the page, there are no checks if the URL parameters exist in 'database', only occurs if you edit URL
- Add active/current both in header links and for topics
- If you write /wiki/ in the live version it does not load, and does not return nomatch component, just standard error
